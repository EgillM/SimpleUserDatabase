This is a simple database application that I was asked to implement as part of a job application process.

They told me I could choose any languages and structures to complete the assignment. I decided to make it really hard on me and choose everything I had never seen, let alone used.

The application in implemented in **Go**.
The API is **GraphQL**,
and the database management system is **MongoDB**.


## How to build, run, and start the server

Open the workspace in VSCode, and when it has been built, run this command in the terminal. 
```sh
go run ./server.go
```

Then you can access the application via http://localhost:8080.


## How to develop locally

The following are the implemented functions.

CreateUser
UpdateUser
DeleteUser
User (this searches for one user)
Users (this lists all users)
